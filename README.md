# ProjectDelta

A New DeFi experience with new features. As of Known, Investing is always catching the right Asset which is going to be more worth 
then the initial Investment. Crypto Investments are more volatile due to low MarketCap and also becuase of the questioning the Technology. 
What if we don't have to fear of loosing our Money just because that one Asset lost value. What if we don't have to speard our basket,
and keep track of each Investment one by one. What If we let people Invest in one Asset that diversifies the Portfolio for us? 
Yes its been used for Stocks as of Known ETFs. And there are more ETFs trading on the Stockmarket then the Stocks itself. We spread the 
Eggs for you. We take care of the diversification for you. For that we will charge you a performance Fee only if you made some Profit!

Well in which point is the DeFi itself? Well once the Contract is Deployed and created we will have a self sustaining system, for know 
it will be on beta and have some upgradeable parts. Untill we have a sustainable and working product we will run on Beta. 
After a Successfull working Product, it will be decentralized and self Sustaining. New DecentralizedExchangeTradedFunds (DETF)'s will 
be on their way, as soon we are comfortable that the Product fits our Expectations. 


################################################ LATER ON TO BE BUILD ################################################################

Later on we will host a DAO to take the Decentralization of ProjectDelta a step further. Truly Decentrailzed and decided by the People 
who are willing to commit for the future of Decentralization

For future features we will ask everyone who want's to use the Feature to commit his NativTokens of ProjectDelta. 
Staking with fixed APR/ flexible APR  and varying lockup periods.
